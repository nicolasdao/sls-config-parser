# Serverless Config File Parser &middot; [![serverless](http://public.serverless.com/badges/v3.svg)](http://www.serverless.com) [![Tests](https://travis-ci.org/nicolasdao/sls-config-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicolasdao/sls-config-parser) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) [![Neap](https://neap.co/img/made_by_neap.svg)](#this-is-what-we-re-up-to)
__*sls-config-parser*__ parses serverless.yml files so that its values can be used locally in JS code during development, including automatically setting up environment variables. Its main usage is to set up the environment variables (including the access key and secret from the `~/.aws/credentials` as well as the region from the `~/.aws/config`) locally so it is possible to test functions locally. Setting up the environment variables is done in a package.json script as follow:

```js
"scripts": {
	"start": "node -r sls-config-parser/setenv index.js --inclcreds --stage prod"
}
```

This script sets up the environment variables based on the profile defined in the `serverless.yml` file and the credentials defined in the `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` the file.

> WARNING: The package is in beta. Limitations:
>	- Not tested on Windows.
>	- Only works with YAML files (JSON support coming soon).
>	- No support for CloudFormation intrinsic functions yet (e.g., Ref, !Sub, !Join).

# Install

```
npm i sls-config-parser
```

> Dev dependency VS App dependency:
> Depending on your use case, install it as a dev dependency or as an app dependency. The dev dependency case occurs when, for example, you're only interested in setting environment variables based on your .aws/credentials and your serverless.yml.

# Getting started
## Parsing the serverless.yml
Assuming there is a `serverless.yml` file in your root folder:

```js
const { Config } = require('sls-config-parser')

const defaultCfg = new Config()
const stagingCfg = new Config({ stage: 'staging' })
const prodCfg = new Config({ stage: 'prod' })
const customCfg = new Config({ stage: 'prod', _path:'../path-to-another-config/some-other.yml' })

console.log('DEFAULT CONFIG:')
console.log(defaultCfg.config())

console.log('STAGING CONFIG:')
console.log(stagingCfg.config())

console.log('PROD CONFIG:')
console.log(prodCfg.config())

console.log('CUSTOM CONFIG:')
console.log(customCfg.config())
```

## Getting the environment variables

Let's imagine we have the following `serverless.yml` file:

```yml
service: graphql

custom:
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'dev'}
  dynamoDB:${file(./config/local.yml)}

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs10.x
  region: ap-southeast-2
  profile: fairplay
  stage: ${self:custom.stage}
  environment:
    DATA_01: hello ${self:provider.stage}
    DATA_02: boom boom

functions:
  graphql:
    handler: handler.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: /
          method: ANY
    environment:
      GRAPHQL_ENV_01: graphql_01
      GRAPHQL_ENV_02: graphql_02
  rest:
    handler: handler.rest
    events:
      - http:
          path: /rest
          method: ANY
    environment:
      REST_ENV_01: rest_01
      REST_ENV_02: rest_02

resources:
  Resources:
    UserTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties: 
        TableName: user_${self:provider.stage}
        AttributeDefinitions: 
          - AttributeName: id
            AttributeType: N
          - AttributeName: username
            AttributeType: S
          - AttributeName: data
            AttributeType: M
        KeySchema: 
          - AttributeName: id
            KeyType: N
        ProvisionedThroughput: ${self:custom.dynamoDB.${self:provider.stage}ProvisionedThroughput}
        Tags: 
          - Key: Type
            Value: test
          - Key: Name
            Value: graphql
```

```js
const { Config } = require('sls-config-parser')

const defaultCfg = new Config()

// EXAMPLE 01: Returns an object with all the environment variables (both global and local to all functions).
// For example: env.DATA_01 -> 'hello dev', env.GRAPHQL_ENV_01 -> 'graphql_01', env.REST_ENV_01 -> 'rest_01'
console.log(defaultCfg.env())

// EXAMPLE 02: Returns the same data as above, but as an array rather than an object.
// For example: [{ name: 'DATA_01', value: 'hello dev' }, { name:'GRAPHQL_ENV_01', value: 'graphql_01' }, ...]
console.log(defaultCfg.env({ format:'array' }))

// EXAMPLE 03: Returns the same data as #01, but only focus on the global variables and the 'graphql' function variables.
console.log(defaultCfg.env({ functions:['graphql'] }))

// EXAMPLE 04: Returns the same data as #03, but ignore the global variables.
console.log(defaultCfg.env({ functions:['graphql'], ignoreGlobal:true }))

// EXAMPLE 05: Returns the global variables only.
console.log(defaultCfg.env({ ignoreFunctions:true }))

// EXAMPLE 06: Returns the same data as #01 with the additionnal AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY defined
// in the ~/.aws/credentials file. If there are multiple profiles in the credentials file, sls-config-parser uses the
// profile defined under the provider.profile property in the serverless.yml file (in our case, that profile is called 
// 'fairplay').
// For example: env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -> 'SHWKHSKWHKHKWSW', env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -> 'dbwjdejewgdewdjjgjewdgewdg'
console.log(defaultCfg.env({ inclAccessCreds:true }))

// EXAMPLE 07: Same as #06, but with a custom credentials file.
 console.log(defaultCfg.env({ inclAccessCreds:true, awsCreds:'../path-to-other-creds/other-creds-file' }))
```

## Setting up environment variables

This is the original purpose of this package. This section contains some context in the [Why is it important?](#why-is-it-important) section. If you're already aware of the running a Lambda locally, you can jump to the [Setting things up](#setting-things-up) section.

### Why is it important?

To use the nodeJS AWS SDK (e.g., using it to read or write to a DynamoDB), it must be configured with the access key and access secret or with an IAM policy. The easiest way to perform this is to explicitly set it up in your code:

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
AWS.config = new AWS.Config({ accessKeyId:'WHIWHHIHH', secretAccessKey: 'debwjkdbewkjbdkjedbk', region:'ap-southeast-2' })

const db = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({ apiVersion: '2012-08-10' })
```

This code makes it straightforward to test locally. However, the above approach is not recommended, as it explicitly exposes the access key and secret. A nefarious conributor could use those credentials to exploit your system.

The recommended approach is to configure an IAM policy in the `iamRoleStatements` property of the `provider` section in the `serverless.yml`. Once this is done, the AWS SDK does not require explicit access key and secret, as those are safely set up as environment variables on your Lambda at deployment time. You can then simply use this instead:

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')

const db = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({ apiVersion: '2012-08-10' })
```

And yet, this creates another issue: How do you test this code locally? The answer to this question is easy to understand, but annoying to implement, and that where this package comes into play. To make the above code work locally, the following environment variables must be set up:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_REGION

The first two variables are located under the `~/.aws/credentials` file while the third one is under the `~/.aws/config`. You could manually set those variables in a start script in your package.json as follow:

```js
"scripts": {
	"start": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=******* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=********** AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2 node index.js"
}
```

However, this is far from being flexible. Besides, there might be more environment variables to set up based on your `serverless.yml` file (which could also define a specific `provider.profile` value influencing the value of the access key and secret). Ideally, those variables are automatically set up based on the correct selected stage of the `serverless.yml` file. That's exactly what this package offers.

### Setting things up

> PREREQUISITE: The following assumes that you have a `~/.aws/credentials` and a `~/.aws/config` file properly configured (i.e., the profile defined in the `serverless.yml` under the `provider.profile` property exists).

To set up all the environment variables in your local environment, add a script in your package.json similar to this:

```js
"scripts": {
	"dev": "node -r sls-config-parser/setenv index.js --inclcreds --stage dev"
}
```

> To know more about this script's API, please refer to the [`sls-config-parser/setenv` API](#sls-config-parsersetenv-api) section of the [Annexes](#annexes).

To run your Lambda locally, just run:

```
npm run dev
```

# Overriding serverless.yml properties

Sometimes you may need to overide some serverless.yml properties in your package.json scripts (e.g., you wish to set up a specific provider's profile without setting one up in the serverless.yml file). You can achieve this with the `--force` option as follow:

```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "node -r sls-config-parser/setenv index.js --inclcreds --stage prod --force 'provider.profile=neap;provider.region=ap-southeast-2'"
}
```

# Annexes
## `sls-config-parser/setenv` API

```js
"scripts": {
	"dev": "node -r sls-config-parser/setenv index.js --inclcreds --stage dev"
}
```

The `-r` options means _require_. This requires the JS file located under the path `sls-config-parser/setenv.js`. This file executes a function which takes the options `--inclcreds` and `--stage dev` and sets up the environment variables defined in the `serverless.yml` and in the `~/.aws/credentials` and a `~/.aws/config` files. Once this is done, the `index.js` file is executed. 

The options for the `sls-config-parser/setenv.js` function are:
- __`--inclcreds`__: If specified, this means the environment variables defined in the `~/.aws/credentials` file and in the `~/.aws/config` file must be set up. Otherwise, only the variables of the `serverless.yml` are included.
- __`--stage <stage-name>`__: Defines which stage must be used in the `serverless.yml`.
- __`--path <path-value>`__: Specifies another location for the `serverless.yml`.
